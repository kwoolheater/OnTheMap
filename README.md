On The Map

This is an app that posts location information to a shared map, pulling the locations of fellow Nanodegree students, with custom messages about themselves or their learning experience. One of the biggest challenges I had to overcome in the app was concurrency while working with table view controllers. I had to work around the fact that loading the student locations was done in a background queue and didn't happen immediately.

Installation

This is a pretty straight forward installation, clone the repository and then run it on your device or a device simulator.
